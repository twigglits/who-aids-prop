Simpact Cyan
============

## Quickstart Guide

Please go to [PRE-REQUISITES](PRE-REQUISITES.md) to get started.

Simpact Cyan is the C++ version of the [Simpact](http://www.simpact.org/) family 
of programs. It is an agent based model (ABM) to study the way an infection 
spreads and can be influenced, and is currently focused on HIV and HIV-HSV2 co-infection.

The main documentation can be found at 
[simpactcyan.readthedocs.io](http://simpactcyan.readthedocs.io/).

Source code packages and pre-compiled versions can be found 
[here](http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/jori/simpact/programs/).

Compiling Simpact Cyan on OS X
------------------------------

You need to have [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) installed,
as well as the [TIFF library](http://www.libtiff.org/), and 
[CMake](https://cmake.org) is needed to generate the build files.
While you can download the CMake tool from the website, and you
can compile and install the GSL and TIFF libraries manually, I find
it easier to use pre-compiled versions of these things, which I
made available using the [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
environment. For these instructions, I'm going to assume that you have 
installed Anaconda Python. 

 1. Download the Simpact Cyan source code and extract it somewhere, or clone
    the GitHub repository somewhere. Below, I'll assume that this has created
    a path called `/Users/me/simpactcyan`.

 2. Open a Terminal window, and make sure that the Anaconda environment
    has been activated, i.e. that the `conda` command is recognized. If
    not, it may be necessary to update your `PATH` environment variable
    using a command like this

        export PATH=/Users/me/anaconda/bin:"$PATH"

    or run Anaconda's activation command:

        source /Users/me/anaconda/bin/activate

 3. Execute the following commands to set up the build environment:

        conda install cmake
        conda install gcc
        conda install -c jori libtiff
        conda install -c jori gsl

    These commands will make sure CMake is available, that the GNU C compiler
    (gcc) is available, and that precompiled versions of the TIFF and GSL
    libraries will be installed.

 4. We need to create a directory where the build files will be stored,
    let's create a directory `/Users/me/simpactcyan/build` for this. In
    that directory, we'll call the `cmake` command, setting the
    CMake variable `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to the Anaconda path (this is
    needed so that the TIFF and GSL libraries can be located correctly).

        cmake /Users/me/simpactcyan -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/me/anaconda

 5. When the CMake step is finished, you can now just run

        make

    to start building the Simpact Cyan executables, or use something like

        make -j 4

    to start four build jobs in parallel, which can speed up the process if
    your computer or laptop has several processor cores.

 6. When the build is complete, running e.g. `./simpact-cyan-release` will
    most likely show an error message about a library not being loaded. To
    tell the system where the TIFF and GSL libraries can be found, execute

        export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/me/anaconda/lib

    Afterwards, running `./simpact-cyan-release` will show a usage message.

 7. To make sure that this version is used from within an R session, execute
    the following commands **before** loading the `RSimpactCyan` package:

        Sys.setenv(PATH=paste("/Users/me/simpactcyan/build",Sys.getenv("PATH"),sep=":"))
        Sys.setenv(PYTHONPATH="/Users/me/simpactcyan/python")
        Sys.setenv(SIMPACT_DATA_DIR="/Users/me/simpactcyan/data/")
        Sys.setenv(DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/Users/me/anaconda/lib")

    The first line makes sure that `RSimpactCyan` will be able to locate the
    compiled executables. The second line makes sure that the Python module 
    that's stored in that directory will be found. The third line tells the 
    library where the data files can be found. Note that the data directory 
    needs to end with a single `/`. The last line makes sure that the executable
    can find the GSL and TIFF libraries which are stored in the Anaconda
    directory structure.

    Only after these lines have been set can you load the library:

        library("RSimpactCyan")

    If you then use e.g. the `simpact.run` command, the newly compiled versions
    are used.

 8. The previous step allows you to run the new executables from within R, 
    but to debug the code this is not the most convenient way to run the 
    program. Instead, first create a configuration file using e.g. the
    `dryrun` option of  `simpact.run`. You can then just run the executable
    from the command line, as described in the 
    [manual](http://simpactcyan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simpact_conf_and_running.html#running-from-command-line),
    for example:

        ./simpact-cyan-debug /path/to/config.txt 0 opt


Compiling Simpact Cyan on GNU/Linux
-----------------------------------

Using your package management system, make sure to install the development
versions of the GSL and TIFF libraries. For Debian or Ubuntu systems, the GSL 
package will be called something like `libgsl-dev` or `libgsl0-dev`, and the
TIFF package will be `libtiff-dev`, `libtiff4-dev` or `libtiff5-dev`. For
Fedora based systems, the packages will be `gsl-devel` and `libtiff-devel`.
Apart from a C++ compiler, and the `make` build system, you'll also need to 
have [CMake](https://cmake.org) (can be installed using the `cmake` package).

 1. Download the Simpact Cyan source code and extract it somewhere, or clone
    the GitHub repository somewhere. Below, I'll assume that this has created
    a path called `/home/me/simpactcyan`.

 2. We need to create a directory where the build files will be stored,
    let's create a directory `/home/me/simpactcyan/build` for this. In
    that directory, we'll call the `cmake` command:

        cmake /home/me/simpactcyan

 3. When the CMake step is finished, you can now just run

        make

    to start building the Simpact Cyan executables, or use something like

        make -j 4

    to start four build jobs in parallel, which can speed up the process if
    your computer or laptop has several processor cores.

 4. When the build is complete, running e.g. `./simpact-cyan-release` will
    will show a usage message.
    
 5. Then we need to add this to one of our paths specified on the $PATH variable.
```
ln -s /home/jupyter/who-aids-prop/build/simpact-cyan-release /usr/local/bin/simpact-cyan-release

```

 5. To make sure that this version is used from within an R session, execute
    the following commands **before** loading the `RSimpactCyan` package:

        Sys.setenv(PATH=paste("/home/me/simpactcyan/build",Sys.getenv("PATH"),sep=":"))
        Sys.setenv(PYTHONPATH="/home/me/simpactcyan/python")
        Sys.setenv(SIMPACT_DATA_DIR="/home/me/simpactcyan/data/")

    The first line makes sure that the `RSimpactCyan` will be able to locate the
    compiled executables. The second line makes sure that the Python module 
    that's stored in that directory will be found. The last line tells the 
    library where the data files can be found. Note that the data directory 
    needs to end with a single `/`. 

    Only after these lines have been set can you load the library:

        library("RSimpactCyan")

    If you then use e.g. the `simpact.run` command, the newly compiled versions
    are used.
```

 6. The previous step allows you to run the new executables from within R, 
    but to debug the code this is not the most convenient way to run the 
    program. Instead, first create a configuration file using e.g. the
    `dryrun` option of  `simpact.run`. You can then just run the executable
    from the command line, as described in the 
    [manual](http://simpactcyan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simpact_conf_and_running.html#running-from-command-line),
    for example:

        ./simpact-cyan-debug /path/to/config.txt 0 opt

Compiling Simpact Cyan on MS-Windows
------------------------------------

Make sure you use Visual Studio 2015. In the following I'm assuming a 32-bit
build (as this also works on 64-bit systems), but a 64-bit build should work
as well, with some obvious changes to the commands.

 1. The source code needs GSL and TIFF libraries to build; to speed things up
    pre-compiled versions can be downloaded from: 
    [simpact_vs2015_deps.rar](http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/jori/simpact_vs2015_deps.rar).
    Extract these somewhere, below I'll assume that after extraction you have
    a directory called `c:\simpact_vs2015_deps\32bit`. If you've extracted the
    RAR archive somewhere else you'll need to change some paths in the instructions
    below.

 2. To be sure that the DLL files for the GSL and TIFF libraries can be found
    when executing the generated Simpact Cyan executable later on, add the
    `c:\simpact_vs2015_deps\32bit\bin` directory to the PATH environment
    variable (see e.g. [this link](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)
    if you don't know how to do this).

 3. Download the Simpact Cyan source code and extract it somewhere, or clone
    the GitHub repository somewhere. Below, I'll assume that this has created
    a path called `c:\projects\simpactcyan`.

 4. In that path, there's a file called `CMakeLists.txt`. Using a tool called
    [CMake](https://cmake.org/), this file will be analyzed and a Visual Studio
    project will be created. Make sure CMake is installed and start the GUI.

 5. In the top part of the window, you need to fill in where the source code
    is, and where to build the binaries. In the source code field, fill in
    `c:\projects\simpactcyan`. The build directory is arbitrary, that's just
    where the compiled files and executables will be stored, I typically use
    something like `c:\projects\simpactcyan\build`.

 6. We want to make sure that CMake can find the GSL and TIFF libraries, which
    is why we'll do the following: click the `Add Entry` button, enter
    `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` where it says `Name`, specity `PATH` as the `Type`,
    set the `Value` field to `c:\simpact_vs2015_deps\32bit` and click `Ok`.
    In the central part of the window, you'll see this `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`
    appear.

 7. In the main CMake GUI, press the button `Configure` and you'll get a 
    window that asks to specify the generator for the project. There, you should 
    be able to select `Visual Studio 14 2015` (the version number of Visual 
    Studio 2015 is 14). 
    
 8. If everything works correctly, you'll see a bunch of red lines appear in the
    same part of the window where the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` was shown. If you
    click `Configure` again, they should become white, and the `Generate` button 
    should be possible to click. If there are still some red lines, it's possible 
    that you have to press `Configure` once more. After clicking `Generate`,
    a file called `c:\projects\simpact\build\simpact-cyan.sln` should be created.

 9. Open this `.sln` file (the 'solution' file, which is the name for a
    project in Visual Studio) with Visual Studio 2015. When this has been started,
    we'll be able to actually compile the source code and build the executables.

 10. By default, you'll see that `Debug` option is selected in the bar below the
    menu bar. This means that the debug version of the code will be compiled. You 
    can also change this to `Release` (and even some other things), which will 
    compile the optimized version of the code. For now, we'll just leave this at
    `Debug`.

 11. In the solution explorer, probably at the right of the Visual Studio window,
    you'll see the `ALL_BUILD` subproject. If you right-click this, you'll get
    a pop-up menu where the top item is `Build`. Click this to start the
    compilation process.

 12. If all went well, the folder `c:\projects\simpactcyan\build\Debug` should
    now contain the executable called `simpact-cyan-debug.exe`. Since this
    is a command line program, we'll start it from the command line: open
    the 'Command Prompt' and go to the specified directory. If you then
    type `simpact-cyan-debug`, the program should output some usage information.

 13. To compile the release version, simply change the the selection from step
    10, right click `ALL_BUILD` again and select `Build`.

 14. To run the version you're working on from within R, you need to run the
    following commands **before** loading `RSimpactCyan`:

        Sys.setenv(PATH=paste("c:\\projects\\simpactcyan\\build\\Debug;c:\\projects\\simpactcyan\\build\\Release",Sys.getenv("PATH"),sep=";"))
        Sys.setenv(PYTHONPATH="c:\\projects\\simpactcyan\\python")
        Sys.setenv(SIMPACT_DATA_DIR="c:\\projects\\simpactcyan\\data\\")
    
    The first line makes sure that the `RSimpactCyan` will be able to locate the
    compiled executables. Note that you need to have both the debug and release
    executables. The second line makes sure that the Python module that's stored
    in that directory will be found. The last line tells the library where the 
    data files can be found. Note that double backslashes need to be used (or
    a single normal slash), and that the data directory needs to end with `\\`
    (or with a single `/`). 

    Only after these lines have been set can you load the library:

        library("RSimpactCyan")

    If you then use e.g. the `simpact.run` command, the newly compiled versions
    are used.

 15. The previous step allows you to run the new executables from within R, 
    but to debug the code this is not the most convenient way to run the 
    program. Instead, first create a configuration file using e.g. the
    `dryrun` option of  `simpact.run`. 
    
 16. In Visual Studio, right click the `simpact-cyan` subproject and select 
    `Set at StartUp Project`. Right click the `simpact-cyan` subproject again
    and select `Properties` at the bottom of the menu. In this properties
    dialog, make sure that the drop-down list next to `Configuration:`
    (at the top-left of the dialog) is showing `Debug`. In the tree view on
    the left, you should see a `Debugging` option in the `Configuration Properties`,
    which you need to select.

 17. In the option on the right that appear then, you'll see an empty input
    field named `Command Arguments`. There, you'll need to fill in the arguments
    to the executable, as described in the [manual](http://simpactcyan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simpact_conf_and_running.html#running-from-command-line). So this would be something like

        c:\path\to\generated\configfile.txt 0 opt

    After pressing `Ok` to store the settings and close the dialog, make sure
    you set the active version to `Debug` (and not `Release`) in the bar below
    the menu bar. Pressing F5 then not only starts the program with the specified
    configuration, but also starts the Visual Studio debugger, allowing you to
    set breakpoints at various locations.
